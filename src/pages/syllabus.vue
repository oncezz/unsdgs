                  This module will introduce the course by conceptually mapping
                  the nexus between trade and the sustainable development goals
                  (SDGs). The module will discuss the mechanisms by which trade
                  can potentially influence some SDGs and the mechanisms by
                  which achieving the SDGs can influence trade patterns. The
                  module will also highlight that while some SDGs may not
                  directly link to trade or trade policy, unregulated trade may
                  indirectly deteriorate and impact their achievement. This
                  module will focus on all the SDGs.

                  conceptual mechanisms by which trade promotes economic growth
                  and employment and discuss the controversial relationship
                  between trade and inequality. It will summarise some stylized

                  It will touch on multinational corporations and outsourcing
                  and their potential effects on poverty and inequality. It will
                  discuss the role that complimentary policies may have in

                  will critically assess this notion conceptually before
                  highlighting that importing food is not (necessarily) a

                  between international trade and economic growth. It will then
                  provide a review of the existing literature on trade and
                  economic growth. It will highlight both potentially positive
                  and negative trade effects on growth and introduce the notion
                  of inclusive growth. This module will focus on SDGs: 1, 3, 4,

                  environmental sustainability. It will focus on whether trade
                  makes the task of dealing with CC effects and maintaining a
                  healthy environment easier or more difficult. The module will
                  also introduce concepts such as sustainable growth and
                  sustainable trade. It will investigate the pros and cons of
                  the nexus between trade and sustainable growth. It will
                  intuitively discuss how trade can be used as a channel to
                  achieve inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction. It
                  will then discuss evidence highlighting the circumstances that
                  facilitate and impede this process. This module will focus on

                  The second module on sustainability turns attention to the
                  challenge of sustaining growth in the long run. This module
                  focuses on human capital accumulation and the transmission of
                  gains from growth and development to the next generation.
                  These are two essential elements in efforts to escape the

                This module has four components that will focus on trade and
                decent work. It begins with an introduction of decent work and
                labour standards. It then discusses labour market consequences
                of international trade. We examine how trade improves workers’
                quality of life through higher wages— and increases incentives
                for labor exploitation at the same time. We end our discussion
                by discussing the role of domestic and international
                institutions in mitigating the undesired effects of trade. This
                module will focus on SDGs: 8 and 9.

                This module will conceptually discuss how trade can influence
                efficiency and innovation. It will discuss the
                productivity-enhancing effects of trade, and the
                complementarities between trade (and FDI) and efforts to reach
                critical SDGs. This module will focus on SDG 9.

                perspective. It discusses consumer roles in creating more
                sustainable trade patterns and influencing how products are
                produced and supplied. It will touch on issues surrounding
                consumer activism and their potential effect. It will introduce
                issues associated with voluntary and forced trade standards
                applied to international supply chains. This module will focus
                on SDG 12.

            >Module A.1: Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals, a general
            overview</b
          >
          <br />This module will introduce the course by conceptually mapping
          the nexus between trade and the sustainable development goals (SDGs).
          The module will discuss the mechanisms by which trade can potentially
          influence some SDGs and the mechanisms by which achieving the SDGs can
          influence trade patterns. The module will also highlight that while
          some SDGs may not directly link to trade or trade policy, unregulated
          trade may indirectly deteriorate and impact their achievement. This
          module will focus on all the SDGs.
          <br />
          <br /><b>Module A.2: Trade and development: tools and trends </b
          ><br />This module will introduce the relationship between trade and
          the economy of a developing country. It will present conceptual
          mechanisms by which trade promotes economic growth and employment and
          discuss the controversial relationship between trade and inequality.
          It will summarise some stylized facts about developing country trade
          volumes, growth and patterns.
          <br />
          <br /><b>Module A.3: Trade and environmental issues </b><br />This
          module will introduce the relationship between trade and the
          environment. It begins with the conceptual framework, and illustrates
          this with some examples from trade and environmental issues in the
          developing countries.
          <br />
          <br /><b>Module A.4: Trade policy reforms and the SDGs </b><br />This
          module reviews trade policy reforms and their interactions with
          efforts to attain SDGs. It includes a discussion of the effects of
          tariffs and tariffs reforms on incomes and income distribution. It
          continues to a discussion on how trade policy has shifted to address
          issues of sustainability and inclusive growth. This module spans the
          full range of SDGs.

          <br /><br /><b>Part B: Intermediate modules</b><br />
          <br /><b>Part B.1: Trade, Poverty, Hunger and inclusive growth</b>
          <br />These modules focus on the following SDGs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and
          10.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.1.1: How does trade affect poverty and inequality?</b
          >
          <br />This module will conceptually discuss the conceptual mechanisms
          by which trade affects poverty and inequality before summarising the
          existing empirical evidence on the two. It will touch on multinational
          corporations and outsourcing and their potential effects on poverty
          and inequality. It will discuss the role that complimentary policies
          may have in allowing the growth-related effects of trade to be
          channelled toward equitable growth. This module will focus on SDGs: 1,
          2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.1.2: Should we use trade restrictions to achieve zero
            hunger?</b
          >
          <br />This module will discuss issues surrounding food security and
          the notion that some nations restrict trade to achieve this. It will
          critically assess this notion conceptually before highlighting that
          importing food is not (necessarily) a problem. This module will focus
          on SDGs: 1 and 2.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.1.3: Does international trade cause (inclusive) growth?</b
          >
          <br />This module will begin with an introduction of international
          trade patterns across the world. It will use measures of openness,
          tariffs and Non-tariff barriers to show correlations between
          international trade and economic growth. It will then provide a review
          of the existing literature on trade and economic growth. It will
          highlight both potentially positive and negative trade effects on
          growth and introduce the notion of inclusive growth. This module will
          focus on SDGs: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10.

          <br /><br /><b
            >Part B.2: Trade, climate change and sustainable growth</b
          >
          <br />These modules focus on the following SDGs: 6,7, 11,13,14, and
          15.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.2.1: Trade and sustainability 1: climate change and
            environment </b
          ><br />This module will conceptually discuss trade and the goal of
          environmental sustainability. It will focus on whether trade makes the
          task of dealing with CC effects and maintaining a healthy environment
          easier or more difficult. <br />The module will also introduce
          concepts such as sustainable growth and sustainable trade. It will
          investigate the pros and cons of the nexus between trade and
          sustainable growth. It will intuitively discuss how trade can be used
          as a channel to achieve inclusive economic growth and poverty
          reduction. It will then discuss evidence highlighting the
          circumstances that facilitate and impede this process. This module
          will focus on SDGs: 6,7,11,13,14, and 15.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.2.2: Trade and sustainability 2: education and
            intergenerational mobility </b
          ><br />The second module on sustainability turns attention to the
          challenge of sustaining growth in the long run. This module focuses on
          human capital accumulation and the transmission of gains from growth
          and development to the next generation. These are two essential
          elements in efforts to escape the so-called “middle income trap.” This
          module will focus on SDGs: 4, 8 and 11.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Part B.3: Trade, decent work, innovation and responsible
            consumption and production. </b
          ><br />These modules focus on the following SDGs: 8, 9, and 12.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.3.1: Does trade lead to a race to the bottom in labour
            standards? </b
          ><br />This module has four components that will focus on trade and
          decent work. It begins with an introduction of decent work and labour
          standards. It then discusses labour market consequences of
          international trade. We examine how trade improves workers’ quality of
          life through higher wages— and increases incentives for labor
          exploitation at the same time. We end our discussion by discussing the
          role of domestic and international institutions in mitigating the
          undesired effects of trade. This module will focus on SDGs: 8 and 9.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.3.2: How does trade influence productivity and innovation? </b
          ><br />This module will conceptually discuss how trade can influence
          efficiency and innovation. It will discuss the productivity-enhancing
          effects of trade, and the complementarities between trade (and FDI)
          and efforts to reach critical SDGs. This module will focus on SDG 9.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.3.3: Trade and responsible consumption/production</b
          >
          <br />This module will discuss gains from trade from a consumer
          perspective. It discusses consumer roles in creating more sustainable
          trade patterns and influencing how products are produced and supplied.
          It will touch on issues surrounding consumer activism and their
          potential effect. It will introduce issues associated with voluntary
          and forced trade standards applied to international supply chains.
          This module will focus on SDG 12.

          <b>Part A: Introductory modules</b><br /><br />
          <b
            >Module A.1: Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals, a general
            overview</b
          >
          <br />This module will introduce the course by conceptually mapping
          the nexus between trade and the sustainable development goals (SDGs).
          The module will discuss the mechanisms by which trade can potentially
          influence some SDGs and the mechanisms by which achieving the SDGs can
          influence trade patterns. The module will also highlight that while
          some SDGs may not directly link to trade or trade policy, unregulated
          trade may indirectly deteriorate and impact their achievement. This
          module will focus on all the SDGs.
          <br />
          <br /><b>Module A.2: Trade and development: tools and trends </b
          ><br />This module will introduce the relationship between trade and
          the economy of a developing country. It will present conceptual
          mechanisms by which trade promotes economic growth and employment and
          discuss the controversial relationship between trade and inequality.
          It will summarise some stylized facts about developing country trade
          volumes, growth and patterns.
          <br />
          <br /><b>Module A.3: Trade and environmental issues </b><br />This
          module will introduce the relationship between trade and the
          environment. It begins with the conceptual framework, and illustrates
          this with some examples from trade and environmental issues in the
          developing countries.
          <br />
          <br /><b>Module A.4: Trade policy reforms and the SDGs </b><br />This
          module reviews trade policy reforms and their interactions with
          efforts to attain SDGs. It includes a discussion of the effects of
          tariffs and tariffs reforms on incomes and income distribution. It
          continues to a discussion on how trade policy has shifted to address
          issues of sustainability and inclusive growth. This module spans the
          full range of SDGs.
          <br />

          <br /><br /><b>Part B: Intermediate modules</b><br />
          <br /><b>Part B.1: Trade, Poverty, Hunger and inclusive growth</b>
          <br />These modules focus on the following SDGs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and
          10.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.1.1: How does trade affect poverty and inequality?</b
          >
          <br />This module will conceptually discuss the conceptual mechanisms
          by which trade affects poverty and inequality before summarising the
          existing empirical evidence on the two. It will touch on multinational
          corporations and outsourcing and their potential effects on poverty
          and inequality. It will discuss the role that complimentary policies
          may have in allowing the growth-related effects of trade to be
          channelled toward equitable growth. This module will focus on SDGs: 1,
          2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.1.2: Should we use trade restrictions to achieve zero
            hunger?</b
          >
          <br />This module will discuss issues surrounding food security and
          the notion that some nations restrict trade to achieve this. It will
          critically assess this notion conceptually before highlighting that
          importing food is not (necessarily) a problem. This module will focus
          on SDGs: 1 and 2.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.1.3: Does international trade cause (inclusive) growth?</b
          >
          <br />This module will begin with an introduction of international
          trade patterns across the world. It will use measures of openness,
          tariffs and Non-tariff barriers to show correlations between
          international trade and economic growth. It will then provide a review
          of the existing literature on trade and economic growth. It will
          highlight both potentially positive and negative trade effects on
          growth and introduce the notion of inclusive growth. This module will
          focus on SDGs: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10.

          <br /><br /><b
            >Part B.2: Trade, climate change and sustainable growth</b
          >
          <br />These modules focus on the following SDGs: 6,7, 11,13,14, and
          15.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.2.1: Trade and sustainability 1: climate change and
            environment </b
          ><br />This module will conceptually discuss trade and the goal of
          environmental sustainability. It will focus on whether trade makes the
          task of dealing with CC effects and maintaining a healthy environment
          easier or more difficult. <br />The module will also introduce
          concepts such as sustainable growth and sustainable trade. It will
          investigate the pros and cons of the nexus between trade and
          sustainable growth. It will intuitively discuss how trade can be used
          as a channel to achieve inclusive economic growth and poverty
          reduction. It will then discuss evidence highlighting the
          circumstances that facilitate and impede this process. This module
          will focus on SDGs: 6,7,11,13,14, and 15.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.2.2: Trade and sustainability 2: education and
            intergenerational mobility </b
          ><br />The second module on sustainability turns attention to the
          challenge of sustaining growth in the long run. This module focuses on
          human capital accumulation and the transmission of gains from growth
          and development to the next generation. These are two essential
          elements in efforts to escape the so-called “middle income trap.” This
          module will focus on SDGs: 4, 8 and 11.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Part B.3: Trade, decent work, innovation and responsible
            consumption and production. </b
          ><br />These modules focus on the following SDGs: 8, 9, and 12.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.3.1: Does trade lead to a race to the bottom in labour
            standards? </b
          ><br />This module has four components that will focus on trade and
          decent work. It begins with an introduction of decent work and labour
          standards. It then discusses labour market consequences of
          international trade. We examine how trade improves workers’ quality of
          life through higher wages— and increases incentives for labor
          exploitation at the same time. We end our discussion by discussing the
          role of domestic and international institutions in mitigating the
          undesired effects of trade. This module will focus on SDGs: 8 and 9.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.3.2: How does trade influence productivity and innovation? </b
          ><br />This module will conceptually discuss how trade can influence
          efficiency and innovation. It will discuss the productivity-enhancing
          effects of trade, and the complementarities between trade (and FDI)
          and efforts to reach critical SDGs. This module will focus on SDG 9.
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >Module B.3.3: Trade and responsible consumption/production</b
          >
          <br />This module will discuss gains from trade from a consumer
          perspective. It discusses consumer roles in creating more sustainable
          trade patterns and influencing how products are produced and supplied.
          It will touch on issues surrounding consumer activism and their
          potential effect. It will introduce issues associated with voluntary
          and forced trade standards applied to international supply chains.
          This module will focus on SDG 12.
